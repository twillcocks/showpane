# Changelog

## 0.2.8 (2026-04-12)

### Fixed — Portal Create Handoff
- **Stricter create-flow contract** — `portal-create` now has an explicit canonical org lookup step, requires `--org-id` in the documented slug-validation path, and points directly at the selected toolchain template file instead of leaving room for repo spelunking or ad-hoc command guessing
- **CLI authorize sign-in redirect fixed** — `showpane-cloud` now bounces signed-out users from `/cli/authorize` through sign-in/sign-up and back to the code entry page instead of letting them hit an `Unauthorized` dead end
- **Portal-aware local login redirect** — local auth redirects now preserve the requested portal slug so the shared login route can render portal-specific context instead of losing the target portal immediately

## 0.2.7 (2026-04-12)

### Fixed — First-Run Handoffs
- **Portal onboarding no longer guesses local org context** — the guided first-run flow now has a canonical local org lookup path before portal creation, so Claude does not need to spelunk the repo or improvise ad-hoc SQLite queries just to continue the wizard
- **Preview handoff is more coherent** — the onboarding flow now carries generated local credentials into preview and preserves the requested portal slug when auth redirects back to the shared login page
- **Deploy auth guidance matches the real login flow** — `/portal-deploy` now treats `showpane login` and `~/.showpane/config.json` as the source of truth for cloud auth, and points signed-out users to the real Showpane Cloud sign-in/sign-up path
- **Installer prompts tightened again** — first-run installer copy now asks for work email explicitly, uses the softer PATH prompt wording, and seeds a neutral `Point of contact` title instead of a misleading founder default

## 0.2.5 (2026-04-11)

### Changed — First-Run Onboarding
- **Installer collects account basics up front** — `npx showpane` now asks for company name, full name, email, and website/domain before scaffolding so the local workspace starts with real org context instead of re-asking those details later
- **Onboarding tone tightened** — `/portal-onboard` now opens with a shorter, calmer first message, asks one thing at a time, defaults telemetry silently to anonymous, and moves into portal work without extra setup narration
- **Real command names in user-facing copy** — docs, setup text, localhost welcome copy, cloud onboarding pages, and email/provisioning copy now consistently use the actual hyphenated slash commands such as `/portal-onboard` and `/portal-deploy`
- **Demo seed removed from normal first run** — the local seed path now creates the real organization from installer answers and no longer relies on the seeded demo org/portal fallback for standard installs

## 0.2.4 (2026-04-09)

### Fixed — Local SQLite Reliability
- **Absolute SQLite path for fresh installs** — new local Showpane projects now write an absolute `DATABASE_URL` for the default SQLite database, so Prisma setup, the Next.js runtime, and the generated app all resolve the same `dev.db` file instead of drifting across relative paths

## 0.2.3 (2026-04-09)

### Changed — Installer Progress
- **Animated create-flow progress fixed** — the `npx showpane` installer now drives long-running setup commands through a non-blocking path, so the spinner can actually animate during dependency install, database setup, and app startup
- **More natural in-progress labels** — setup steps now read as `Creating`, `Installing`, `Configuring`, and `Starting` while work is underway, instead of showing the past-tense step names before anything has finished
- **First-run PATH setup prompt** — interactive installs now offer to add `~/.showpane/bin` to your shell PATH once, so future terminals can run `showpane claude` directly instead of falling back to `npx showpane claude`

## 0.2.2 (2026-04-09)

### Changed — First Run Clarity
- **Canonical Claude command on localhost** — the local welcome page now consistently presents `showpane claude` as the main command, with `npx showpane claude` only shown as a fallback note when needed
- **Clear terminal handoff** — both the success card in the installer and the localhost page now explicitly tell users to open a new terminal window before running Claude, so they do not try typing into the terminal that is already streaming local app logs
- **Visible install progress** — the `npx showpane` stepper now uses the animated create-flow progress UI during project creation instead of static arrows for each install step
- **Installer smoke coverage updated** — the local smoke test now asserts the new success-card guidance so the terminal handoff copy does not silently regress

## 0.2.1 (2026-04-09)

### Changed — First Portal Onboarding
- **Local welcome page refresh** — localhost onboarding now focuses on one Claude start command, two strong first-portal prompt examples, and a direct guide CTA instead of a numbered setup stack
- **Canonical first-portal guide** — public docs now center on `app.showpane.com/docs/first-portal` with transcript patterns, best practices, common mistakes, and a walkthrough slot
- **Early portal guidance nudge** — `/portal-create` now points first-time users to the guide for the first three org-scoped portal creations, then stays quiet after that

## 0.2.0 (2026-04-08)

### Added — Showpane Cloud Platform
- **Cloud platform** (`platform/`) — hosted at app.showpane.com, $29/mo flat with 7-day trial
- **Clerk auth** — signup, login, team management with org-level access
- **Stripe billing** — single-tier subscription with webhook-driven provisioning
- **Sequential provisioning** — Stripe → Supabase org → Vercel project → subdomain → env vars → welcome deploy → email
- **Vercel Platforms API** integration — create projects, assign subdomains, deploy portals
- **CLI device auth** — `./setup --cloud` with browser-based authorization flow
- **Engagement dashboard** — feed-first 3-panel layout with stats cards and activity feed
- **Team access** — invite by email, roles (owner/admin/viewer), member management
- **Getting started** page — 3-step post-signup onboarding
- **Docs** — quickstart, self-hosted deploy, and cloud setup guides

### Added — Engagement Intelligence (portal app)
- **Visitor tracking** — `sp_visitor` first-party UUID cookie (30-day, no PII)
- **Section time analytics** — Intersection Observer tracks which sections are viewed and for how long
- **Expanded event types** — `section_view`, `section_time`, `file_download`, `share_link_access`
- **visitorId + metadata** on PortalEvent model for session-level analytics
- **"Powered by Showpane"** badge in portal footer

### Changed — Multi-Tenant Foundation
- **Prisma schema**: SQLite → PostgreSQL canonical provider
- **Cascade deletes** on PortalEvent and PortalFile when portal is deleted
- **Full tenancy identity rewrite** — all tokens carry organizationId, all DB lookups scoped by org
- **`getAuthenticatedPortal()`** replaces `getAuthenticatedSlug()` — returns `{orgId, slug}`
- **npx installer** uses `prisma db push` (works with SQLite despite Postgres schema)

### Security
- **Constant-time bearer comparison** in file upload routes (`timingSafeEqual`)
- **Path traversal guard** in local storage (`safePath()`)
- Linux binary targets for Vercel serverless deployment
